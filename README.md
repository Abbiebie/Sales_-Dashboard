- What occupation of customers patronized Robbinâ€™s company the most?
- What is the total profit actualized during the period?

Professionals patronized Robbin's company the most.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis result, we recommend the following actions:

- Robbins company should diversify in product offering, that is they should focus on increasing revenue
from accessories, clothing, and components to reduce reliance on Bikes. This can be approached by bundling and 
cross-selling strategies (e.g., a Bike Starter Kit including helmets, gloves and clothing)
- Replicate Sales Growth Drivers: Investigate the factors contributing to the mid-2016 to early 2017 spike to replicate 
success.
- Also create exclusive product collections to generate interest, such as seasonal or trendy items in clothing.
